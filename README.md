<h1>It's not dead, it's resting <img src="./icons/logo.svg" width="24" alt="" /></h1>

Browser extension to replace the ùïè logo in twitter.com with a bird.

Replaces the logo in:

- Mobile and desktop site headers
- Loading screen
- [Favicon] (shown on browser tabs and bookmarks)
- TweetDeck loading screen
- TweetDeck favicon

Uses CSS to replace the images, so it doesn't impact performance, and the images are replaced instantly instead of flashing the original image.
